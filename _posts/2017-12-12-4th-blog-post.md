    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>At the beginning my keyboard didn't work but I tried a few options and got it to work out  </td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked if our mothership was going to be on a timer or a randomiser.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Even though my code wasn’t working I tried to fix it on my own without getting my partner to try and help</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I looked back and realised that part of my code wasn’t the same as everyone else's (I had done it in a different way)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I tried to put my hand up and wasn’t distracted by other things going on and was always watching the board when I needed to</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I made a few silly mistakes like setting my keyboard to another setting and then when I was in trouble I went straight to the teacher instead of trying to collaborate with my partner. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If I’m told to (rarely) copy something of the board or classroom I need to follow it more precisely, because I am making lots changes and I know this okay most of the time, but it's starting to make a variety of changes to my work which is setting it apart from others.  </td>
