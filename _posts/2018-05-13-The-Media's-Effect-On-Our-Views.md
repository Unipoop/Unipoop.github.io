    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We sat down and watched some videos that we had posted on classroom about the fact that the media will change almost anything.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for the end of the lesson was to understand that the media affects our views and decisions heavily. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I now think that I have a good understanding of the media's effects and have a good understanding of the way it affects people differently, mainly because we all watch and read different things. </td>
