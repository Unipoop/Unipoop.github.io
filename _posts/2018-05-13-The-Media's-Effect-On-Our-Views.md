    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We sat down and watched some videos that we had posted on classroom about the fact that the media will change almost anything.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for the end of the lesson was to understand that the media affects our views and decisions heavily. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I now think that I have a good understanding of the media's effects and have a good understanding of the way it affects people differently, mainly because we all watch and read different things. </td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I tried my best to take in my surroundings and look at the decisions my other classmates had chosen as we all had two options in our question game.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to constantly ask myself questions as I needed certain information to answer questions.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I chose my side of the room on what I chose, not on what my friends did but I wasn't always truthful with my answers. </td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We looked back at what we had gone over last week and looked at some videos that linked with it.</td>
