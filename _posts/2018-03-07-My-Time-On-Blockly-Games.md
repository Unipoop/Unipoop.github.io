    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have completed the levels: Maze,Turtle and Pond</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Well, I completed maze and turtle but I couldn't finish pond but we didn’t have to finish them all as long as we put in some effort.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I couldn't find the right code combinations I kept putting in new combinations and trying new things until I completed it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself if combinations were worth putting in or not but I couldn’t ask the teacher because the work was done at home.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own for a good amount of time with minimal distractions.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>When trying to think of code for maze if I couldn’t remember what a block meant I would go back and see what it was.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I tried to put as much effort as possible into my work and I did a decent amount of work in the end.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

    <td>I could have completed a bit more of pond as in the end I didn’t finish all the levels.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should try to do as work as I possibly can and if I can’t complete it I can ask for a bit of help to try and give me a boost on doing it. This may give me the opportunity to complete it. </td>
