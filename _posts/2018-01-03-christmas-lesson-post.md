    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>We had to make some christmas changes to our blogs and we were also set a challenge of making it snow using JavaScript. </td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, by the end of the lesson I had changed my background and refined some areas like my titles and boxes.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had changed my background to a christmas picture but it not worked I went back and checked the code but nothing was wrong. However when I went back to the page I refreshed it using F5 a few times and eventually it came through.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I was confused why I no longer had boxes around by posts but when I thought about it I checked my cod and my box code had been deleted. I think I must have removed it when editing another piece of code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Our teacher told us to search up a blog and note down what makes a good interesting blog so we typed it in to the search engine and I used my initiative by following the link to the website, where as some of my classmates had to raise their hands and ask if this was the right thing to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>At the beginning of the lesson we were looking through some of our blogs on the board and mine came up, our teacher said that my coulor scheme was good but my titles did not explain what the post was about, so I went back and changes them to a more fitting explanation.</td>
