  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started a chat about what piece of social media we use the most.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand that too much social media becomes stupid and that causing someone harm or not reporting it is a massive problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I now know that posting about every little detail in my life is silly and that I should always try to help people in trouble and if I can't I should always immediately report it. </td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We were told to come up with 10 rules to use in social media, my group and I came up with about 7 before we couldn't think of anymore, but I persevered by trying my absolute hardest to come up with some more, which then inspired my team to keep going.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked "What was the Arab Spring?"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When we were writing up our rules I just wrote mine down without having to constantly having to keep everyone updated with what I just wrote.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After the lesson lots of my classmates and I talked about the subjects brought up and how we would have handled the situation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened as hard as I could and felt really interested in some of the points made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not necessarily in my working, but one of the boys in my group kept deleting the the text I wrote which definitely hindered my working speed.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will tell him to stop more regularly and if he still continues I will report him to the Teacher.</td>
