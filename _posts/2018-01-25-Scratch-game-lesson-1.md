    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't know how to make sprites ask questions but I tried some different options like making it speak and then an interaction but eventually I got the right combination.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>In the last lesson I had created agame plan but when coming into this lesson I realised that it was not practical and I wouldn’t be able to do it so I asked our teacher if it would be possible to create a different game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I tried to keep to myself and use my own skills, instead of looking at others work and stealing ideas.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>As I have already said, my original game was impractical so I came up with a new game and I really like it and plan to make it really grow in character.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I got to work as soon as possible, keeping to my aim and not taking part in conversations that were not relevant to the lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Thinking more back to the last lesson, I should have thought more deeply about my plan and how I was actually going to be able to code what I wanted, if I had done this a bit more professionally then i would have spent less time fooling around about it in the lesson giving me more time to code in the actual lesson.   </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to stick to my initial ideas, but make sure that they are practical aims and ideas not something that I like the sound of but can’t actually do.</td>
