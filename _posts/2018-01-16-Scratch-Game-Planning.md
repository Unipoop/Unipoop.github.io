    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a good plan that will inform people of what our games will be about</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I completed the sheet to what I think is a decent standard and I also handed in a second sheet with extra information</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked my teacher if my game could be based of a game that is already around, however I am going to make sure I make changes allowing the game to be different and stand out.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I wanted to know if we were allowed to use pictures in our plans. At first I was going to put my hand up but I then realised it was a stupid question and then as long as I was benefiting my design then it would be alright.</td>

    <td>I should have listened better, at one point I was on scratch about to create code but I remembered we should just be planning not coding. If I had listened in the first place I could of have a much longer and better plan because I wouldn’t of had wasted such a large amount of my time doing the wrong thing.  </td>
