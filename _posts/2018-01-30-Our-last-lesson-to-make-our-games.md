    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I couldn't find a second costume for my sprite and no matter how hard I looked I could not find one. However, I then remembered that I could edit costumes and i just duplicated it and changed it slightly.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I wasn’t sure on which days we would be able to enter the I.T labs, i then found out it is on: Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I wanted to make a few of my sprites move across the screen, but I wasn’t quite sure on how to do that. I knew that the boy sitting next to me was aware of how to do this but instead of just asking for the answer i spent some time trying out some combinations and eventually I got there.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After the lesson I went home and worked on my game even more, the next day when i came into school I went and worked in the I.T labs the whole time thinking about what i could do better than in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td> I gave up my free time to work on it even though I had done the maximum amount of time needed because i want to get a good grade. </td>

    <td>The two boys next to me were having a conversation about their games and testing each others out. We were given permission to talk but not to aid each other as it would no longer be our work. Also we weren’t meant to test our games yet as that is to be done in a future lesson.

These boys were talking and playing and I was roped in and joined in which wasn’t the right thing to do.  </td>
