    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Trying to play an entire game in 5 minutes can be challenging so I tried really hard to get the whole thing done in the available time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked the owners of the games if they had any specific things to try and any rules.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Once I had given feedback to the other people I went and worked on my own Instead of still interacting with them. </td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Really, the whole lesson was reflecting because at the end I looked back at my work and wrote down some improvement points for my game.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
