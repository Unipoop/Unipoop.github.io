    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have successfully made changes that were suggested by my peers.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, by the end I had made all the changes that my classmates had said and I tried some of my own.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had been given the idea of making question answers infinite, if you get it wrong you will just have to try again infinitely. For ages I couldn't get it to work but in the end I did. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked if I could add in more sprites/change them so it becomes more clearer or more fun.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I chatted to some people about a few ideas at time but for almost the rest of the lesson I worked on my own.,,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Well, I spent the whole lesson looking back at my work and taking information from text I already had.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I worked on my own for most of the lesson and tried to be as focused on my work as possible even when I was conferring with other people.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was very set on making specific changes that other people had given me and only those ideas. I had my own thoughts but I was a bit afraid to use them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should stick to my thoughts and be brave enough to do what I think is right, seeing as it is my game. </td>
