    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We logged in and went on to the website lightbot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for the lesson was just to complete as many coding levels as possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did, I did go very far in comparison to the rest of the class and I tried very hard to get there, I found it challenging but not impossible so I was very happy with my result of reaching level 3-6.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I was stuck on what I believed to be the hardest level I kept on trying out new combinations and trying to understand it better until I eventually completed it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself if proc1 and proc2 could have any other uses instead of just allowing more code to be added on to the rest of my script. I learnt that they did have another use which was to create loops that would complete the levels with much less code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When I became stuck on a certain level I tried to complete it myself instead of asking for the answers from my teacher and friends.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After the lesson I went back to the website and tried to beat the level I was stuck on and analyze what I wasn't doing correctly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was trying my absolute hardest to do well in the task and I new that I was really engaging in it because I felt really good when I got past a level I had been stuck on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When I first started some of the harder levels I wasnâ€™t thinking hard enough of what I could have done, for example I was still trying to use proc1 and proc2 as additions to the code when I should have been using them as loops.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I should use the skills that I am given like loops, because they make the work easier, less stressful and faster. </td>
