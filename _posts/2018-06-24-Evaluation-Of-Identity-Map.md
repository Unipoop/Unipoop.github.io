Evaluation Of Identity Map

On Monday the 18th of June I came into class with my latest piece of homework, our task had been to create an identity map and bring it in to show to the class. I spent a lot of time on my work and feel like it had been done to a very decent standard, but that wasn't important, but what my classmates (random people on social media) did.

I created a google document and put it up in my place (so did everyone else) and every few minutes or so we would switch and type a message on someone else's' work. I tried to be relatively nice to people and keep my comments on the work, but I did critique a lot. However we were given the option to be a bit mean about some of the work they wrote as we were meant to be recreating social media commenting. 

I feel that since we have started this social media topic my sense of people's feelings online has grown deeply and I now try to be much kinder on the internet as it makes myself feel better and improves their lives a lot.

To the point of my comments, overall people were actually quite nice to me, saying how I put lots of effort in and was a good person, referring to my stories of saving animals and my deliberately non-sexist points. This all came to me as a big shock as I was definitely expecting a much more negative reception. Below you can see the actual comments:

You have included many ideas about every aspect of what makes you yourself.Maybe you could have  included a bit more about how you use social media and how you might use it in the future.

Shay-I think this is an excellent map which has a lot of effort put in. I think you should include more about social media and how you will use it in the future.

There is enormous amounts of colour and i love the mindmap style of work. There are pictures relating to all the different pieces of information and there is a clear title in the centre (me). I would have liked the information to have been clearer, in the different sections i.e. family etc. but it is still a great piece of work.

There is a lot of colour and a tonne of information about yourself. You could have written a little bit neater.

There is a lot of colour in it and i like how you put that your best friend is a girl and you don't care. You also included a lot about your personal side like your allergies and conditions.

In this identity map you included included a lot of colour, which makes it very vibrant and appealing to look at. As well as this, you made sure to go into detail in your spider diagram and add captions, so you used some writing. However, try to use more pictures to support your points, but very good!

I like all the pictures that were hand drawn which shows just how much effort went in to this and there is lots of colour which really makes it pop out, very good.

The Map shows colour and info and i think you did really well to extend your work with subtopics.

You included good pictures but there isn't much information so try and use more writing. You could have used darker colours to make it easier to read.

You have got a lot of information about yourself and what you like to do but you could maybe make it a bit more clear which points link up to each other.

It shows how your family have an effect on you. It is great that you have empathy for the animals that suffer and you are thoughtful

I like how you put about how you are a bit of a rebel and I like how you coloured it very well.

Very colorful piece of work.

Nice effort but more info would be better.

Really good piece of work nice mind map.;;/

WWW:You have good colour, good images and made it eye-catching.

EBI: Include more info about the types of media you use.

WWW: I like the use of the colours

EBI: You didn't cross out the cross. There other ways you can say that

From Aws Khafagi

WWW: good use of colour and i like how you linked everything together for example you said you liked rugby then said your origin was scotland which then linked to you supporting scotland in rugby, nice

EBI: more extended writing on what social media you will use in the future as you don't use any now.
